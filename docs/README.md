# _flos_  experimental operating system

![flos](https://github.com/arseniuss/flos/blob/master/docs/logo.png?raw=true)

This repository contains a new version of _flos_ experimental operating system. As previous  version this is experimental staff so **THERE IS NO WARRANTY**.

Last project was abondoned because I wanted to learn new things.

_flos_ is Plan9, Unix and Xok/Aegis inspired operating system. Also it will include programming language called _cell_ and standard libraries. 
Plan is to make portable libraries with os-specific background implementation.

**TODO:** write a good description
